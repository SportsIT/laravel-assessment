# Laravel Assessment: TODO API

## Setup
This project should use [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/) to provide an API that can be consumed by a front-end application.

Please fork this repository and show us what you've got!

P.S. An easy way to work on this is to use GitHub Codespaces by clicking on the "<> Code" button on the repository and creating a new codespace. You would then run `composer install` in the terminal, followed by `php artisan serve`.

## Requirements
### Design
The API is a minimized (and slightly altered) implementation of the [JSON:API v1.0](https://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/) specification.

### Functional Requirements
A full OpenAPI specification of the requirements can be found [here](./openapi.yaml) and can be visualized by pasting its contents into [Swagger's online editor](https://editor-next.swagger.io/) to be easier to understand.

#### Extra Credit Ideas (Just for fun!)
- Implementing a pagination strategy or filtering for collection endpoints
- Implementing any other features in the full JSON:API specification
- Write functional HTTP tests covering core behaviors
- Add behaviors for custom ordering of todos

## Time Estimate
About 2-3 hours, depending on your experience level. There is no time limit, this estimation is for you to plan your time.
